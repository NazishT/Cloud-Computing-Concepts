## The key-value abstraction

## Scale out, not scale up
- Scale up = grow your cluster capacity by replacing with more powerful machines
    - Traditional approach
    - Not cost-effective, as you're buying above the sweet spot on the price curve
    - And you need to replace machines offten
- Scale out = incrementally grow your cluster capacity by adding more COTS machines(Components Off the Shelf)
    - Cheaper
    - Over a long duration, phase in a few newer(faster) machines as you phase out a few older machines
    - Used by other companies who run datacenters and clouds today
