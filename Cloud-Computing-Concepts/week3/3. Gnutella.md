## Gnutella
- Elimate the servers
- Client machines search and retrieve amongst themselves
- Clients act as servers too, called sercents.

## Gnutella Structure

## How do I search for my beatles file?
- Gnutella routes different messages within the overlay graph
- Gnutella protocol has 5 main message types
    - Query(search)
    - QueryHit(response to query)
    - Ping(to probe network for other peers)
    - Pong(reply to ping, contains address of another peer)
    - Push(used to initiate file transfer)
- Message structure and protocol
    - little-endian: 0x12345678 stored 0x78 in lowest address byte, then 0x56 in next higher address, and so on.
- |Descriptro ID | Payload descriptor | TTL | Hops | Payload length|
  |--------------|--------------------|-----|------|---------------|
  |0-15          |16                  |17   |18    |19           22|

## Gnutella Search
- TTLï¼šhow many times to forward the message
- QueryHit message(0x81):successful result to a query
    -|Num.bits|port|ip_address|speed|fileindex,filename,fsize|servent_id|
     |0       |1   |3         |7    |11                      |n     n+16|

## Ping & Pong
- a Gnutella peer receives a Ping message from one of its neighbors, which of the following actions does it perform?
    - forwards it to appropriate neighbors after checking TTL
    - creates a Pong message about itself and reverse routes it
    - if it was the original peer that initiated the Ping, it uses received Pong responses to update its membership lists
    - reverse routes any Pong messages it receives
