## How do I search for my beatles file?
- Gnutella routes different messages within the overlay graph
- Gnutella protocol has 5 main message types
    - Query(search)
    - QueryHit(response to query)
    - Ping(to probe network for other peers)
    - Pong(reply to ping, contains address of another peer)
    - Push(used to initiate file transfer)
- Message structure and protocol
    - little-endian: 0x12345678 stored 0x78 in lowest address byte, then 0x56 in next higher address, and so on.
