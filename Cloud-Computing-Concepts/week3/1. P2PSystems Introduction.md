## Why study Peer to Peer Systems
- First distributed systems that seriously focused on scalability with respect to number of nodes
- P2P techniques abound in cloud computing systems
    - Key-values stores(e.g., Cassandra, Riak, Voldemort) use Chord p2p hashing

## What we will study
- Widely deployed P2P system
    - Napster
    - Gnutella
    - Fasttrack
    - BitTorrent
- P2P Systems with Provable Properties
    - Chord
    - Pastry
    - Kelips
