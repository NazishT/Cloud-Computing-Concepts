## Gossip-Style Failure Detection

## Protocol
- Nodes periodically gossip their membership list
- On receipt, the local membership list is updated

- If the heartbeat has not increased for more than **T-fail** seconds, the member is considered failed
- And after **T-cleanup** seconds, it will delete the member from the list
- Why two different timeouts?
