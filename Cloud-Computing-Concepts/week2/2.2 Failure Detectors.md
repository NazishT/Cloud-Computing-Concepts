## I. *pj* Crashes
- Nothing we can do about it!
- A frequent occurence
- Common case rather than exception
- Frequency goes up linearly with size of datacenter

## II. Diatributed Failure Detectors: Desirable Properties
- ***Completeness*** = each failure is detected
    - **Guaranteed**
- ***Accuracy*** = there is no mistaken detection
    - Partial/Probabilistic guarantee
- Speed
    - Time to first to detection of a failure
- Scale
    - Equal Load on each member
    - Network Message Load

## Centralized Heartbeating
- 1 to all

## Ring Heartbeating
- A ring. 1 by 1.
- every one send heartbeating to its neighbors, anticlockwise and clockwise.

## **ALL-TO-ALL heartbeat**

## Next 
- How do you increase the rebustness of all-to-all heartbeating?
