## Some Implementations
- Clearinghouse and Bayou projects: email and database transactions[PODC '87]
- refDBMS system [Usenix '94]
- Bimodal Multicast [ACM TOCS '99]
- Sensor networks [Li Li et al, Infocom '02, and PBBF, ICDCS '05]
- AWS EC2 and S3 Cloud(rumored)['00s]
- Cassandra key-value store (and others) use gossip for maintaining membership lists
    > Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra)
- Usenet NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol)['79]

## NNTP Inter-Server Protocol

## Summary
- Multicast is an important problem
- Tree-based multicast protocols
- When concerned about scale and fault-tolerance, gossip is an attractive solution
- Also known as ***epidemics***
- Fast, reliable, fault-tolerant, scalable, topology-aware
