## Faliure detector

## Optimal
- Completeness               ---Guarantee Always
- Accuracy                   ---Probability PM
- Speed                      ---T time units
    - Time to first detection of a failure
- Scale
    - Equal Load on each member
    - Network Message Load

## What's the best/optimal we can do?
- Optimal L is independent of N
- All-to-All gossip-based: sub-optimal
    - L = O(N/T)
    - try to achieve simultaneous detection at all processes
    - fail to distinguish Failure Detection and Dissemination components
- Key
    - Separate the two componets
    - Use a non heartbeat-based Failure Detecion Component
