## Failures are the norm
    not exception, in datacenters.

- Say, the rate of the failure of one machine (OS/disk/motherboard/network, etc.) is once every 10 years (120 months) on average.
- When you have 120 servers in the *DC*, the **mean time to failure(MTTF)** of the next machine is 1 month.
- When you have 12, 000 servers in the DC, the **MTTF** is about once every 7.2 hours.

## To Build A Failure Detector
- [ ] Hire 1000 people to monitor
- [x] Write a failure detector program(distributed)

## Target Settings
- Process 'group'-based systems
    - Clouds/Datacenters
    - Replicated servers
    - Distributed databases
- Crash-stop/Fail-stop process failures

## Group Membership Service
