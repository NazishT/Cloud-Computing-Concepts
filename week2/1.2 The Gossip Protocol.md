### The gossip-based protocol
- is executed periodically at each node
- may receive multiple duplicate gossips that contain the same multicast message
- can turn an uninfected node into an infected nodes
- can't turn an infected node tnto an uninfected node  

### Push vs. Pull
- Push
    - Once you have a multicast message, you start gossiping about it
    - Multiple messages? Gossip a random subset of them, or recently-received ones, or higher priority ones
- Pull
    - Periodically poll a few randomly selected processes for new multicast messages that you haven't received
